  Dukkha-facing fox case checks
================================================================================

The concrete fox grid lives in `Consequences/FoxCase.lean`. This adjacent
doctrine module adds only the Four Truths vocabulary needed to say that a
clenched fox-life reception is the worked dukkha example.

Reading and motivation: Identification/Commentary.lean, C.7a.
